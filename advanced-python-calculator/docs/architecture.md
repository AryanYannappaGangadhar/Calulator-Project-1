# Architecture of the Advanced Python Calculator

## Overview
The Advanced Python Calculator is designed to provide a robust and user-friendly interface for performing mathematical calculations. The architecture is modular, allowing for easy maintenance and extensibility. The application is divided into several components, each responsible for specific functionalities.

## Components

### 1. Core Calculator Logic
- **Location**: `src/calculator/core.py`
- **Description**: This module contains the `Calculator` class, which implements basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It serves as the foundation for all calculations performed by the application.

### 2. Input Parsing
- **Location**: `src/calculator/parser.py`
- **Description**: The `Parser` class is responsible for interpreting user input. It converts raw input strings into a structured format that can be processed by the evaluator. This ensures that the application can handle various input formats and errors gracefully.

### 3. Expression Evaluation
- **Location**: `src/calculator/evaluator.py`
- **Description**: The `Evaluator` class takes parsed expressions and computes their results. It handles operator precedence and supports complex expressions, making it a critical component for accurate calculations.

### 4. Mathematical Functions
- **Location**: `src/calculator/functions.py`
- **Description**: This module includes additional mathematical functions, such as trigonometric and logarithmic functions, which can be utilized by the core calculator logic. This enhances the calculator's capabilities beyond basic arithmetic.

### 5. Constants
- **Location**: `src/calculator/constants.py`
- **Description**: This file defines important mathematical constants like Ï€ (pi) and e (Euler's number), which can be used in calculations.

### 6. User Interface
- **Location**: `src/ui/app.py`, `src/ui/views/main_window.py`, `src/ui/views/widgets.py`
- **Description**: The UI is built using a modern framework, providing an intuitive interface for users. The `MainWindow` class sets up the layout and connects UI elements to their functionalities. Custom widgets enhance user interaction.

### 7. Theming
- **Location**: `src/ui/themes/default.qss`
- **Description**: This stylesheet defines the visual appearance of the application, allowing for a consistent and appealing user experience.

### 8. Services
- **History Management**: `src/services/history.py` - Manages the history of calculations, enabling users to view past results.
- **Settings Management**: `src/services/settings.py` - Handles user preferences, such as theme settings and calculator configurations.
- **Plugin Management**: `src/services/plugin_manager.py` - Facilitates the integration of plugins to extend the calculator's functionality.

### 9. Utilities
- **Logging**: `src/utils/logger.py` - Provides logging capabilities for tracking events and errors within the application.
- **Decorators**: `src/utils/decorators.py` - Contains utility decorators for enhancing function behavior, such as execution timing and result caching.

## Testing
The application includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests located in the `tests` directory. Each module has corresponding tests to ensure functionality and reliability.

## Conclusion
The architecture of the Advanced Python Calculator is designed for scalability and maintainability. By separating concerns into distinct modules, the application can be easily extended with new features and improvements while ensuring a high-quality user experience.
